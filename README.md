## 1. Dataset and Analysis

Anonymized survey data from competitions and capstone courses are provided as CSV files. 

- 2025-1 Capstone design survey were conducted non-anonymously to enable paired-sample analysis.
- Other surveys were conducted anonymously


Analysis includes:

- Mean and SD
- Paired and independent t-tests
- Cohen’s d
- 95% Confidence Intervals
- Correlation

Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to share the raw data for peer evaluation and final exam scores. Instead, we provide only aggregated statistics to ensure participant confidentiality.
